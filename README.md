# Objective

The objective of this project is to build an API using Laravel 10 that manages sports-related data, such as Players, Teams, and Games. 

This API must implement authentication using Sanctum and a mechanism for generating an X-Authorization header for external access.

Additionally, this application should follow Laravel's repository pattern and integrate itself with a public sports API for data importation.
