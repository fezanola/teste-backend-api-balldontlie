# Objective

The objective of this project is to create an API using Laravel 10 that manages data related to sports, such as Players, Teams and Games. 

This API must implement an authentication using Sanctum and a solution to generate an X-Authorization header for external access.

Additionally, this application must follow Laravel's repository pattern and integrate itself with a public sports API for data importation.
